# Trade Bot Project

## Overview
This project involves the development of a high-frequency trading bot capable of processing thousands of orders per second, aimed at revolutionizing the trade markets. The bot will use advanced algorithms to adapt to market changes dynamically, minimize overfitting, and maximize profits. This project also serves as a practical introduction to algorithmic trading concepts and techniques.

---

## Objectives
- Create a trading bot that operates in a simulated trading environment.
- Develop algorithms to optimize trading performance and profitability.
- Justify the bot’s performance with thorough analysis and insights.
- Compete against other bots using datasets provided during evaluation.

---

## Features
1. **Dynamic Market Adaptation**:
   - Real-time response to market changes.
   - Avoids overfitting to training datasets.
2. **Strict Decision Grammar**:
   - Implements a defined order syntax for trades.
   - Ensures all orders are valid and executable.
3. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - Utilizes training datasets and a generator for simulation.
   - Competes with other bots in a fair evaluation environment.
4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Tracks profitability and consistency.
   - Adjusts strategies based on evaluation feedback.

## Project Setup
### Prerequisites
- Programming language of your choice (ensure compatibility with provided client-server interface).
- Access to training datasets and the generator provided.
- A reverse-engineering setup for analyzing server logs.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd trade-bot
   ```
2. Install required dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Example for Python
   ```
3. Setup the client-server interface:
   - Download the client-server bootstrap files.
   - Configure the location of your bot and command-line instructions.

### Running the Bot
1. Start the client-server interface.
2. Point the server to your bot’s executable.
3. Observe and analyze performance metrics generated by the interface.

## Development
### Architecture
1. **Data Input**:
   - The server provides general game settings and initial training data.
   - Live updates include market rates and account balances.
2. **Decision Logic**:
   - The bot processes input data and makes trade decisions within seconds.
   - Implements the grammar: `pass` or `buy/sell <currency_pair> <amount>`.
3. **Order Execution**:
   - Validates trades to ensure they adhere to rules and account constraints.

### Key Challenges
- Balancing trade speed with decision accuracy.
- Preventing overfitting to training datasets.
- Adapting to unseen evaluation datasets.

### Tools & Libraries
- While scientific libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, SciPy, Pandas, Numpy) are not available, custom tools can be built.
- Recommended: Python for algorithm implementation and analysis.

## Usage Guidelines
### Input Format
1. **Settings**:
   ```
   settings <variable> <value>
   ```
2. **Market Rates**:
   ```
   update game next_candles <rate>;<rate>;<rate>
   ```
3. **Account Balances**:
   ```
   update game stacks <currency>:<amount>,<currency>:<amount>
   ```

### Output Format
1. **Pass Command**:
   ```
   pass
   ```
2. **Trade Command**:
   ```
   buy <currency_pair> <amount>
   sell <currency_pair> <amount>
   ```

## Evaluation
### Metrics
- Profitability: Total net gains across trading sessions.
- Adaptability: Performance on evaluation datasets.

### Avoid Common Pitfalls
- Overfitting deterministic algorithms.
- Invalid trades leading to program collapse.
