    Attributes:
        bot_settings (Settings): Configuration and settings for the trading bot.
        prices (dict): Dictionary tracking buy and sell prices with list values.
        debug (Debugger): Debugger instance for logging and debugging purposes.

    Methods:
        run(): Main loop that continuously processes user input commands.
        parse(command: str): Parses and processes input commands to update settings or make trades.
        make_decision(): Analyzes market data and makes trading decisions for each currency pair.

        1. Reads a line from standard input
